My Implementation:
On the structure from [2], I have made a single player mode of the Pong Game and with additional background music and sound effects.
The game is vertical, and runs with a timer which resets after some time (the game looks like it freezes for a fraction of a second, but doesn't really affect gameplay. When it comes to the music and sounds, they can be found at [6] and [7], the music being edited to be smaller in size and looped, while the sound effects are used for interaction with the paddle and the score reset.
