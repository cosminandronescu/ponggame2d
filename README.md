# ponggame2d

I have made a simple 2D Pong Game using JavaFX.
The game is a single player game where you can move a paddle left to right using the "a" and "d" keys. 
The ball which will start moving in a random direction, will speed up every time the paddle interacts with it and, at the same time, the score, which can be seen at the top, will update.
You can also pause the game with the ESCAPE key.

Disclaimer: I have tried adding multiple panels for a start menu and a pause menu, but because of some errors I gave up on it for now. I will try to add them until the presentations.
